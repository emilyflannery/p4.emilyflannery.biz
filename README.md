The app I developed for Project 4 is a recipe app for users to browse and save favorites to each users unique "My Recipes" page. The user is able to sign up, log in, edit profile information, and add and remove recipes to "My Recipes". 

I use jQuery for form validation (sign-up and profile edit), and to show and hide the recipe details. Users are restricted to using a unique email address, and cannot leave fields blank. 

Thanks to all the instructors for all your dedication and help throughout this semester.
